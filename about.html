  <h1>COSMIC ORIGINS</h1>
  <p>
    In many ways, my life has been shaped not only by those around me but by the changes to my world which are inherent of the cosmic forces by which I wield no power to sway in my favour but only by the glory of those who went before us and those who will come after us and look at us with nothing but pity, for this shall all come to pass.
