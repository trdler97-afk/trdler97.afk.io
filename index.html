    <p>
        Your project structure is now correct. Soon everything will work out as I expect it to. 
        It might be hard at first but, God willing, everything will fall into place. 
        Through a very painful and long process I have learnt that growth—and not just any growth—takes time. 
        Learning a new skill, improving yourself, or just figuring out what your purpose was meant to be is hard, very very hard. 
        But if you hold on for just long enough and believe, then everything will fall right into place.
